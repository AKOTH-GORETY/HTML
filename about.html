<h4>OUR STORY</h4>
<p1>Aware that women faced a disproportionate amount of challenges due to the extreme gender inequalities that persist in the slums. After being raised by his aunts, mother, and grandmother and having a daughter himself, he felt that he needed to work to change the current conditions as he didn’t want his daughter to grow up in a world so unequal. In 2002, Abdul started a soccer team for girls called, Girls’ Soccer in Kibera (GSK). Their hope was to foster a supportive community, providing emotional and mental support for young women of Kibera by establishing a soccer program. The girls were fast learners when it came to the game of soccer, and soon they were competing against boys’ teams from the community. Soccer was serving as a middle ground for both genders; it provided a space for acceptance and encouragement, and it was Abdul’s hope that this would spread across other aspects of Kenyan society.

The soccer program was a success. However, the looming dangers of slum life persisted as the young women still fell victim to the worst kinds of human atrocities. Rape, forced prostitution, disease, and drugs are all a reality in Kibera for women. Indeed, it was the unyielding injustice of these conditions, which led Abdul to the conclusion that soccer alone was not enough. If systemic change was what they wanted to see happen, they needed to establish a school.

Unfortunately, Abdul was not in a position to finance such an ambitious plan. Selflessly, a friend of Abdul’s offered his own house to serve as the school, and moved in with Abdul in order to keep the project moving. In the meantime, Abdul was able to reach out to friends for financial support and gathered enough funding to purchase tables, chairs, and textbooks for the school. Finally, in 2006, the Kibera Girls Soccer Academy was established and began supporting their first class consisting of eleven girls and two volunteer teachers.

Today, KGSA is composed of 20 full time staff, over 130 students annually, a host of artistic and athletic programming and continues to expand. It is our hope, that through providing academics – in and outside of the classroom, artistic and athletic opportunities, KGSA can inspire the young women of Kibera to become advocates for a movement of change within their own communities, and for Kenya as a whole.
